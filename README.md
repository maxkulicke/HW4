Quiz

This is a music theory quiz, with three difficulty levels. 

The focus of this assignment for me was about dynamic web interaction, especially using jQuery.

I feel like, given more time, I would spend more time styling the front end, but overall i'm quite happy with the functionality of the back end.

A few notes:
there is some local storage writing in script.js that is very WET, and with more time I would write some for loops to DRY that stuff out.

additionally, there is some error occurring under edge cases that involves the clear high scores button/function, where certain high scores in the hall of fame get displayed as "Null." I am still trying to work that out.

I intentionally did my question storage in a different format/structure as the assignment suggested. It works.

I would also like to implement some function that displays the answers of each question in a random order, such that you wouldn't be able to memorize the position of each correct answer. seems like a more thorough way to do the quiz.

Overall though, i'm pretty pleased with both the ease with which my quiz stores, calls, edits and erases my local storage information. I'm also happy with how dynamic it is, especially with timing, color display with right/wrong answers, and different quiz pathways all displaying on the same 3 modals.
